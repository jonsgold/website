            <li>A mistake in hiring, rectified within 6 months by replacing that employee, costs 2.5 the person's annual salary.</li>
            <li>Example of Tony Razzano, chief scout for the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s - he drafted Joe Montana and Jerry Rice.</li>
            <li>His system was to see 200 plays of the eligible player - watch him in real live situations.</li>
            <li>The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour.</li>

          <ul class="summary">
            <li>Most interviewees prepare for an interview.</li>
            <li>So should the company script some pre-interview plays for which there can be little preparation by the candidate.</li>
            <li>A less predictable interview allows to more accurately evaluate performance on the job.</li>
            <li>Also crucial to evaluate if it will be a good long-term relationship.</li>

            <li>Results of an interview may be misleading, only showing the candidate passed the chemistry and interview tests.</li>
            <li>A good con artist can fool you every time.</li>
            <li>Interviews with induced stress don't work - putting a candidate on the defensive will only put up walls and demonstrate his defensive behavior.</li>

          <ul class="summary">
            <li>Like in fishing, when hiring excellent people, half the battle remains after the candidate leaves your office. Like hooking the fish but not catching it.</li>
            <li>If you keep your eyes and ears open during the post-interview phase, you'll learn more about the candidate's behaviour and track record than you ever thought possible.</li>

            <li>References offer a photo album of strengths and weaknesses.</li>
            <li>We check references every day: we ask about good babysitters, mechanics, etc.</li>
            <li>When it comes to hiring, we balk, not wanting to hear negative information (especially if we like the candidate).</li>
            <li>When we do, we confirm facts instead of asking for information.</li>
            <li>Be persistent, eventually you will discover something. Ask references for references.</li>
