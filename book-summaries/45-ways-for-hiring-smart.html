          <div class="title">Chapter 1: Pre-Interview Strategies</div>
          <ol class="summary" type="i">
            <li>Most interviewees prepare for an interview.</li>
            <li>So should the company script some pre-interview plays for which there can be little preparation by the candidate.</li>
            <li>A less predictable interview allows to more accurately evaluate performance on the job.</li>
            <li>Also crucial to evaluate if it will be a good long-term relationship.</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="strategy">
            <div class="title">Strategy 1: Make Phone Contact with the Candidate</div>
            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>How hard or easy is it to reach the candidate?</li>
              <li>Paradox - some good candidates are uncomfortable on the phone / most con men are terrific on the phone.</li>
              <li>Asleep after lunch? Probably a red light.</li>
              <li>Review time, place and dress for initial interview.</li>
              <li>Example of NY executive in SF interview - didn't follow directions, was late by 1.5 hours without calling, and dressed in a suit.</li>
              <li>5 to 10% of interviewees will screw up this first test.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div class="strategy">
            <div class="title">Strategy 2: Ask for a Letter and Resume</div>
            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>Is the candidate prompt / literate / neat?</li>
              <li>People lie on their resumes - about academic credentials, job responsibilities, previous compensation.</li>
              <li>Example of candidate who never graduated from Vanderbilt University.</li>
              <li>Example of candidate with 4 year gap - was in jail for murder.</li>
              <li>Example of candidate who omitted a past job. Instead of lying, he should have admitted to having had a bad relationship with that boss.</li>
              <li>Deceptive behavior on a resume is a red light.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div class="strategy">
            <div class="title">Strategy 3: Give an Assignment Before the Interview</div>
            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>Ask the candidate to visit a store / office / web page before the interview then ask for his / her observations.</li>
              <li>Demonstrates how the person carries out a task. A candidate that offers insight into the business has spoken volumes before the interview.</li>
              <li>Obviously will give a rave review - but what else does he / she say? Is it helpful, specific, accurate?</li>
              <li>Example of candidate's report to the American Golf Corporation, with specific suggestions which were immediately implemented (he got the job).</li>
              <li>Example of candidate's report to an upstate NY bank, with insightful suggestions for improvement in customer service (she got the job).</li>
              <li>They did not give the impression they would come in and change everything before getting to know operations better.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div class="strategy">
            <div class="title">Strategy 4: Walk Around the Office When the Candidate Arrives</div>
            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>To make small talk and lower anxieties.</li>
              <li>Look for curiosity - does the candidate ask questions?</li>
              <li>Curiosity is a valuable asset, it demonstrates a desire to discover new things - a good sign for a candidate's success.</li>
              <li>Nervousness can lead to no questions asked, but absolutely no questions can give a sense of a person's curiosity level.</li>
              <li>Example of Crate and Barrel company - walked around with COO candidate to see how he reacts with people, and their impression of him.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div class="strategy">
            <div class="title">Strategy 5: Read Resumes in Teams if Possible</div>
            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>One team member will emerge as the resume expert.</li>
              <li>Teams that work together are more accurate and insightful than individuals - depth of reading.</li>
              <li>Example of candidate that worked in Japan and France, but had 9 months of unemployment.</li>
              <li>Discussion was quick and more complete (different views, one team member knew Japan) than with single reader.</li>
              <li>Teams can also waste time / pass over good candidates if they "must have consensus" or a dominant member monopolises the discussion.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div class="strategy">
            <div class="title">Strategy 6: Cast the Widest Net Possible</div>
            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>Improve the candidate pool to raise the bar and get better finalists.</li>
              <li>Let wide range of people know you're looking for better candidates.</li>
              <li>Keep excellent candidates on record - ask them if they know anyone, maybe they'll suggest themselves.</li>
              <li>Recognise excellent people wherever you find them:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>Example of financial whiz found at dinner party that interacted brilliantly with everyone.</li>
                <li>Example of hotel assistant manager that dealt with difficult customer.</li>
              </ol>
              <li>Microsoft's recruiting "Strike Team" is on the phones from 6:00 - 20:00.</li>
              <li>The best candidates are not looking for new jobs.</li>

            <div class="title">Strategy 7: Use Caution Around Any Big Changes</div>
            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>Hiring from big companies to little companies (and other drastic differences) can be dangerous.</li>
              <li>An olympic sprinter doesn't compete in the mile run.</li>
              <li>Begin search for talent within industry / culture / business.</li>
              <li>Also look for less experienced talent within your organisation.</li>
              <li>There are exceptions, but start here.</li>

            <div class="title">Strategy 8: Rethink the Position Before the Interview</div>
            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>Before interviewing for an old job, it's an excellent time to rethink the job itself.</li>
              <li>Example of last creative director that couldn't administer his department - why not split the job: one creative, one administrative.</li>
              <li>Example of Pentagram 3-day retreat: office administrator brought in to work on logistics.</li>
              <li>While rethinking the position, might discover the job isn't necessary.</li>
              <li>Rethinking the position is synonymous with streamlining the position, can the person be utilised more effectively?</li>

            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>Integrating several strategies will eventually save you a lot of time.</li>
              <li>Example of non-profit seeking office manager:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>Cast widest net possible. Placed ad asking for resume and cover letter.</li>
                <li>Ask for cover letter. 20% of candidates were eliminated because they didn't write one.</li>
                <li>Read resumes in teams. Funneled resumes into 3 stacks - pile A would get phone call, pile B maybe, pile C rejects (e.g. with typos or not qualified).</li>
                <li>Make phone contact with applicants. From pile A, found out if easy or hard to reach the candidate, what were his phone skills?</li>

            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>Helpful in identifying paper tigers - people with great resumes but less impressive in person.</li>

              <ol>

          <ol class="summary" type="i">
            <li>Results of an interview may be misleading, only showing the candidate passed the chemistry and interview tests.</li>
            <li>A good con artist can fool you every time.</li>
            <li>Interviews with induced stress don't work - putting a candidate on the defensive will only put up walls and demonstrate his defensive behavior.</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="strategy">
            <div class="title">Strategy 11: Trust Your Instincts - Chemistry Is Crucial</div>
            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>Assuming you've been successful predicting winners in the past, trust your gut.</li>
              <li>Usually determined in the first few minutes of an interview: it's either good, bad or absent.</li>
              <li>Where chemistry is important and it's bad or absent, cut the interview short.</li>
              <li>Prepare all candidates in advance that the initial meeting will be 15 - 20 minutes just to meet and say hello.</li>
              <li>Example of Harry V. Quadracci: never do business with anybody you don't like.</li>
              <li>Example of Colleen Barrett: every time I go against my gut, I regret it.</li>
              <li>Understand your personal biases and prejudices so your initial reaction doesn't eliminate excellent candidates.</li>
              <li>Example of Robin Bradford: she goes slower in an interview when she has a prejudice, and some of the best people she found were outside her comfort zone.</li>

          <div class="strategy">
            <div class="title">Strategy 12: Look for the Passionate Candidate</div>
            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>Passion differentiates the exceptional candidate: she will love her job, she's dedicated, she will work hard.</li>
              <li>When passion is present, the sky is the limit. When it's missing, all bets are off.</li>
              <li>Key ingredients of passion are: energy and enthusiasm.</li>
              <li>Three more ideas to consider:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>Something to prove. Example of Warren Buffett who was rejected from Harvard Business School. Example of Paul Orfalea who is dyslexic - founded Kinko's.</li>
                <li>Athletes, immigrants, entrepreneurs (trust your instincts and past experience):</li>
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>Current passions bodes well for future passion on the job, especially amateur athletes (understand discipline, long hours, teamwork).</li>
                  <li>It's illegal to ask about someone's origin, but immigrants can be dedicated to distinguish themselves in their new country.</li>
                  <li>Strong entrepreneurial backgrounds can be a sign of passion.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Hours. Does he have a track record of working long hours? Can be a sign of passion. Beware of: people that use it to compensate for lesser quality of work, that are self-destructive workaholics.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div class="strategy">
            <div class="title">Strategy 13: Ask All Your Questions at Once</div>
            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>You accomplish three things:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>You pass on the baton - performance depends on the candidate, not you selling yourself or the organization.</li>
                <li>Stops you from talking too much - and telegraphing the answers you want.</li>
                <li>Forces you to listen.</li>
              </ol>
              <li>Example of George Hume, CEO, handed over a sheet with 10 questions. With practice, he eventually became a comfortable, more animated listener.</li>

          <div class="strategy">
            <div class="title">Strategy 14: Have Fun During the Interview</div>
            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>Ask 2 or 3 'Columbo' questions - the candidate should respond accordingly and you'll learn a lot.</li>
              <li>Examples:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>Are you lucky?</li>
                <li>What exactly does a ____ do? Listen for a clear, detailed explanation.</li>
                <li>How are you going to lose money for me?</li>
                <li>Example of Carl Sewell: looks for fidgeting - sign of energetic person.</li>
              </ol>
              <li>Listen for what is left out. Example of COO candidate in all-female board, he left out the women in his life during the interview and was a bad fit.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div class="strategy">

            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>Three quarters through the interview give a task to perform. Demonstrates the candidates behavior and breaks the monotony of the interview.</li>
              <li>Examples:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>Advertising agency asked creative director candidate's opinion about feature with 92-year-old blues singer.</li>
                <li>Crate and Barrel marketing candidate asked about marketing new spring merchandise.</li>
                <li>United Electric Controls asks machinists to interpret a blueprint and mill or fabricate the part. Candidates appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate their skills.</li>
              </ol>
              <li>If an ad agency's candidate has a reel of past work condensed to 15 minutes, absolutely worth it to see. Tells more about his creative abilities than mini-project.</li>
              <li>All mini-projects (initiated by you or volunteered by the candidate) count toward the 200 plays you need to observe to pick the right person.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div class="strategy">

            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>With the end in sight, performance changes.</li>
              <li>People will say something really important at this point, something like 'by the way...', 'I almost forgot...'</li>
              <li>If the interview was good, you may expect a variety of surprises, more about personal issues.</li>
              <li>Example of plant manager thought he would have to work weekends, which he didn't.</li>
              <li>Example of sales manager with sick child who needed health insurance.</li>

            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>Pay attention to the candidate's behavior, not words, especially if you cannot explain it.</li>
              <li>Consider drugs and alcohol whenever you see inappropriate behavior in a qualified candidate.</li>
              <li>Example of university department chair who was offered the position of campus dean. He didn't stop talking about himself without pausing to inhale - which lit a red light. Eventually it was discovered he was an alcoholic.</li>

              <li>No one is good at everything, we all play to our strengths. But strengths in the extreme may predict weaknesses.</li>
              <li>Ask candidates about their strengths and consider what might exist on the opposite side.</li>
              <li>Example of well spoken, charismatic candidate: had possible problems with pressure, might avoid conflict, sweep problems under the rug.</li>

            <ol class="summary" type="i">
              <li>Rule of thumb: if a candidates can go into detail about a subject, they probably have some expertise in that area. If not, the opposite is true.</li>
              <li>The key is to ask questions in your area of expertise in order to recognise another person's expertise.</li>
              <li>You can ask for a 5 minute summary on subjects you aren't expert on.</li>
              <li>Example of the question 'tell me about an employee you had to fire':</li>
              <ol>
                <li>One answered 'never fired anyone'.</li>
                <li>One said he found it very hard.</li>
                <li>One was direct - the employee wasn't performing so he fired him. </li>
              </ol>
              <li>Answer (1) from an experienced candidate should sound a warning bell. Answers (2) and (3) are good, depends on your style.</li>
