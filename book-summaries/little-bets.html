              Chris Rock begins developing material for a new show by doing around fifty appearances in front of several tens of people,
              using a yellow legal pad with ideas scribbled on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              His style during these appearances is sometimes painful to watch, not at all like his performance mode.
              He can ramble, most jokes falling flat. However, he watches the audience intently, looking for clues as to which ideas might have potential,
              adding notes to his pad.
              What he thought was a good idea might completely miss with the audience. Other times, a joke he thought was a dud will bring the house down.
            </p>
            <p>Rock understands ingenious ideas don't spring into the mind fully formed. They emerge through a rigorous experimental process.</p>
            <p>As an investor, the author, Peter Sims, learned the most sucessful entrepreneurs don't begin with brilliant ideas, they discover them.</p>
            <p>Examples:
              <ul>
                <li>The first goal of Google's founders was to solve a small problem: how to prioritize library searches online, which led to the PageRank algorithm.</li>
                <li>Google discovered that their AdWords advertising system was profitable, but they didn't begin with the idea.</li>
                <li>Amazon has a culture of discovery, actually trying new things and ideas is part of employee performance reviews. Jeff Bezos knows you must experiment, you can't predict which ideas will succeed.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              Some ideas don't work. Amazon's history has many features the customers didn't care about. Other ideas exceed expectations.
              Amazon has endured criticism over the years for its failed experiments, however ultimately, the exploratory mentality has spawned continual breakthroughs,
              such as Amazon stores and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              There are two types of innovators: conceptual and experimental. Conceptual innovators (like Mozart) pursue bold new ideas,
              often achieving breakthroughs early in life. Such prodigies are rare.
            </p>
            <p>Experimental innovators (like Rock, Google and Bezos) approach problems using little bets. This type of creativity is more common.
              They use iterative, trial and error approaches to gradually build up breakthroughs. They must be persistent and willing to accept failure.</p>
            <p>
              The advantage of this method is we rarely know what we don't know. Successful inventors and creators understand this.
              Beethoven used experiments to slowly differentiate his style from Mozart's, creating a distinct style. They don't analyze new ideas too much
              or try to predict their success with elaborate plans. They do things to discover what do to.
            </p>
            <p>
              Little bets are concrete actions taken to discover, test and develop ideas that are achievable and affordable. When we can't know what's going to happen,
              little bets help us learn about the factors that can't be understood beforehand. Most successful entrepreneurs, especially those who start with limited capital,
              operate in this experimental way.
            </p>
            <p>
              Little bets are not ways of just trying a lot of things to see what sticks. The most productive creative teams are rigorous, analytical,
              strategic and pragmatic. Even so, this method is not a step by step process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fundamentals of the little bets approach:
              <ul>
                <li><i>Experiment:</i> learn by doing, fail quickly to learn fast.</li>
                <li><i>Play:</i> quiet inhibitions to incubating ideas with a playful, improvisational and humorous atmosphere.</li>
                <li><i>Immerse:</i> get out into the world to gather fresh ideas, understand human desires, absorb how things work ground up.</li>
                <li><i>Define:</i> use insights to define specific problems before solving them.</li>
                <li><i>Reorient:</i> be flexible in pursuit of larger goals, use small wins to pivot and rechart the course when needed.</li>
                <li><i>Iterate:</i> repeat, refine and test frequently using the insights gained from prior iterations.</li>
              </ul>
