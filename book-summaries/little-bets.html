              Chris Rock develops material for a new show in small clubs. Most jokes fall flat, but he watches the audience intently,
              looking for clues as to which ideas have potential. What he thought was a good idea might completely miss. Other times,
              a joke he thought was a dud will bring the house down. He understands ingenious ideas don't spring into the mind fully formed.
              They emerge through a rigorous experimental process.
            </p>
            <p>As an investor, the author, Peter Sims, learned the most sucessful entrepreneurs don't begin with brilliant ideas, they discover them.</p>
            <p>Examples:
              <ul>
                <li>The original goal of Google's founders was to solve a small problem: how to prioritize library searches online. This led to their famous PageRank algorithm.</li>
                <li>Google discovered that their AdWords advertising system was profitable, but they didn't begin with the idea.</li>
                <li>Amazon has a culture of discovery. You need to experiment with ideas, you can't predict which will succeed.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              Some ideas don't work - Amazon's history has many features the customers didn't care about. Some ideas exceed expectations -
              Amazon's exploratory mentality has spawned continual breakthroughs, such as Amazon stores and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              There are two types of innovators: conceptual and experimental. <i>Conceptual innovators</i> are rare, they pursue bold new ideas,
              often achieving breakthroughs early in life. An example is Mozart.
            </p>
            <p><i>Experimental innovators</i> (like Rock, Google and Bezos) approach problems using little bets. This type of creativity is more common.
              They use iterative, trial and error approaches to gradually build up breakthroughs. They are persistent and willing to accept failure.</p>
            <p>
              The advantage of this method is we rarely know what we don't know. Successful creators don't analyze new ideas and plan too much - they do things
              in order to discover what do to. They test and develop ideas by taking concrete actions that are achievable and affordable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fundamentals of the little bets approach:
              <ul>
                <li><i>Experiment:</i> learn by doing, fail quickly to learn fast.</li>
                <li><i>Play:</i> quiet inhibitions to incubating ideas with a playful, improvisational and humorous atmosphere.</li>
                <li><i>Immerse:</i> get out into the world to gather fresh ideas, understand human desires, absorb how things work ground up.</li>
                <li><i>Define:</i> use insights to define specific problems before solving them.</li>
                <li><i>Reorient:</i> be flexible in pursuit of larger goals, use small wins to pivot and rechart the course when needed.</li>
                <li><i>Iterate:</i> repeat, refine and test frequently using the insights gained from prior iterations.</li>
              </ul>

              The tyranny of large numbers: the tendency to think in terms of bigger bets as you get bigger. 1990s Hewlett-Packard were trying new ideas only in
              billion dollar markets. They failed because someone was already in that market.
            </p>
            <p>
              HP had once been a creative company. In 1972, they made the first scientific calculator HP-35. Market research said it wouldn't sell,
              but Bill Hewlett decided to build a thousand and see what would happen. It was a small, affordable bet, and within a few months they were selling
              a thousand calculators a day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fighting the adaptive guerilla warfare of the Middle East, the US army had to change their approach. They immersed themselves
              with the local population to understand the power structure and identify people they can rely on. They made small incremental
              discoveries, gained intelligence so the army's plans could evolve.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two advantages of the little bets approach:
              <ul>
                <li>It enables us to focus on what we can <i>afford to lose</i> instead of making assumptions on how much we can <i>gain</i>.</li>
                <li>It facilitates the <i>development of means</i> as we progress with an idea:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Who we are: our values and tastes.</li>
                    <li>What we know: our expertise, knowledge and skills.</li>
                    <li>Who we know: our networks, friends and allies.</li>
                    <li>Monetary resources.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              1980s Pixar was a hardware company that took little bets on making short films. They were affordable losses which also allowed
              the company to develop its means, including their digital animation expertise, reputation and technology,
              as well as the ability to tell a good story. Eventually they released Toy Story in 1994 to great success.
            </p>
            <p>
              The little bets approach involves failure, sometimes a lot of it. Chris Rock is willing to bomb in front of a small audience night after night.
              Only six out of every 100 new HP products were successes.

          <div class="title">Chapter 2: The Growth Mind-set</div>
          <div class="summary">
            <p>
              A big vision provides the direction and inspiration through which to channel ideas. However, experimental innovativors aren't rigid
              in pursuit of that vision. They accept that they may need to redefine the path or even the ultimate goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Entrepreneurs know making mistakes is essential to their success, that they will make important discoveries by willing to be imperfect.
              By expecting to get things right at the start, we block ourselves psychologically from taking action and choke off opportunities to learn. We open up
              creatively by becoming comfortable with failure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Carol Dweck's research shows that people with a <i>growth mind-set</i> are more likely to succeed than those with a <i>fixed mind-set</i>. Growth
              mind-set people believe intelligence and abilities can be grown through effort. They view setbacks as opportunities for growth. Fixed mind-set people
              believe intelligence and abilities are set in stone, thus they need to prove those abilities. They view failures as threatening to their sense of worth.
            </p>
            <p>
              People with fixed mind-sets tend to gravitate to activities that confirm their abilities. Those with growth mind-setstend to seek activities
              that expand their abilities. They don't believe their performance on every task reflects on their intelligence. Furthermore, praising abilities alone
              reduces persistence, while praising effort leads to growth mind-set behaviors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pixar is an example of a growth mind-set. After several successful movies,
              they hired Brad Bird to shake things up and make sure they weren't becoming complacent. He changed many processes, including focusing high detail
              on only parts of each frame, which saved money per minute in creating The Incredibles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Going from suck to nonsuck: Pixar fosters this mind-set by viewing failures, false starts and problems as the modus operandi for developing films.
              The key is to systematically learn from failures, and closely monitor what's working and what isn't.
            </p>
            <p>
              Taking example from Toyota, Pixar is constantly identifying and solving new problems. Thus, a culture that is unusually open and honest. Pixar is
              as close to a constant learning organization as there is, with a proven ability to reinvent and a genuine cultural humility.
            </p>
            <p>The little bets approach helps us to cultivate and exploratory, growth mind-set. By doing, rather than planning, we can develop growth mind-set muscles.</p>
